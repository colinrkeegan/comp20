        My favorite place is Telluride, Colorado. My family has gone to
        Telluride every 2 to 4 years ever since I was a little kid, so it's a
        very special place to both me and my family. One of many reasons I love
        Telluride is pictured to the left: the natural beauty and majesty of
        the mountains that surround the town.

        My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://www.masalasomerville.com/"
        target="_blank">[Masala]</a>, I love Indian food! <br/> <br/>
        Something no one would expect about me: I am a published author in
        Haiti! <br/>
